Once in the properly cloned folder, run ```npm install``` to install the following dependencies:
 * Inquirer:  ```npm i inquirer```
 * MySQL:  ```npm i mysql``` 
 * Console Table:  ```npm i console.table``` for an easy to read table in your terminal.

 * Add database Schemas and Seeds files to your MySql Workbench to create initial tables.
 * Provide your MySql Workbench password in the ```tracker.js``` file (line 9) to establish your connection.
