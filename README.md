## *Description* 
Assignment is to build a solution for managing a company's employee database using Node, Inquirer and MySQL to be able to view, add and update employees, departments and roles.

## *Installation* 
Clone the Github repo.
```https://github.com/BwayCarl/Employee-Tracker.git```

Once in the properly cloned folder, run ```npm install``` to install the following dependencies:
 * Inquirer:  ```npm i inquirer```

## *Usage*
 Enter ```npm start``` in your command line to begin the queries.
